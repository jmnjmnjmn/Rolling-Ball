# Rolling-Ball
It is a challenging and entertaining 3D control game. In the game, with the help of
LEAP MOTION, users use their hands to control the rolling directions of the ball.
During the rolling process, the ball might come into different landforms, obstacles
and need to trigger some elements to keep the game going. Users aim to pass all these
landforms while avoiding obstacles and reach the destination as fast as they can.
